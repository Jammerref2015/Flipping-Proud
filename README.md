## What's It All About?
Flippin' Proud is a team collaboration project to create an application to celebrate Pride month. The aim is to help educate and bring people together by showcasing important members of the LGBTQ+ community.

Flippin' Proud is an interactive application to promote the important work of a number of LGBTQ+ icons from across the globe. Their work and bravery has helped combat ignorance and intolerance and helped to lay the foundations for others to come forward and work towards a brighter future. 

Users can view images of the icons and click on the image to flip over for some background information on the importance of the individual to the LGBTQ+ community.

The project has been made possible by the hard work and collaboration of the following team of developers:

 - [John Doyle](https://github.com/Aramantos)
 - [Christine Greaney-Kelley](https://github.com/christine-gk416)
 - [Paul Harrington](https://github.com/loosenthedark)
 - [Steven Kenny](https://github.com/SteveKennyUK)
 - [Adrian Looney](https://github.com/Jammerref2015)

## User Experience (UX)
This website will follow the principles of User Centred Design (UCD), which will focus on placing users at the centre of the design and development process.
### User Stories
#### User Goals (general visitor to the site)
 -   As a user, I want to be immediately drawn into the site and understand its main purpose.
 -   As a user, I want to be able to easily identify what I need and navigate the site to get to it.
 -   As a user, I want concise but informative content, displayed in an aesthetic manner.
 -   As a user, I want to be able to view the site clearly and intuitively on different device sizes.
 -   As a user, I expect the site to be fully accessible.
#### Developer Goals 
 -  As a developer, I want to build on teamworking skills and enhance my communication skills.
 - As a developer, I want to practise and improve my current knowledge and skills.
 - As a developer, I want to learn new skills and increase my knowledge of various languages.
 -  As a developer, I want to learn how to use version control within a team environment.
 -  As a developer, I would like to produce a fully responsive application to add to my portfolio of work and showcase to potential employers. 

### Project Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
	It was important to use a bright colour scheme, broadly following the lines of the rainbow flag which is so synonymous with Pride and the LGBTQ+ community. This immediately makes the user feel comfortable and reinforces the subject matter of the site.
	
	The following colour scheme was decided upon with assistance from the [coolors](https://coolors.co/ffca3a-8ac926-1982c4-6a4c93-343330-fffbfe) website:
	
	![Flippin' Proud Colour Scheme](https://github.com/Jammerref2015/Flipping-Proud/blob/master/static/images/Flippin'%20Proud%20Colour%20Scheme.png) 
-   #### Typography
	Montserrat was chosen as the main font to be used for the site. It is a clean font, which is easy to read for accessibility purposes and also a popular font, used on many existing websites with a LGBTQ+ theme. Roboto acts as a second font as this pairs well with Montserrat.
	Sans serif will act as a fallback font in case the chosen fonts are not imported correctly.
-   #### Wireframes 
	Wireframes for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Jammerref2015/Flipping-Proud/blob/master/static/images/flippin-proud-wireframes.pdf)

## Features
### Existing Features
- The site consists of three pages, each with a responsive navigation bar at the top.
- A jumbotron greets users on the landing page, with some introductory information on the nature of the site and a call to action button to take the user to the main flipcard page.
- The main flipcard page is an interactive invitation to the user to learn about the important work that various people have undertaken to improve the LGBTQ+ community.
- A final contact page, setting out information about the site developers.

## Testing
### Validation
- HTML passed through the [validator](https://validator.w3.org/) without any errors. 
- CSS passed through the [validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) without errors.
- JavaScript passed through the [validator](https://jshint.com/) without any errors.
### Responsiveness
- Google Dev Tools and various device sizes were used extensively to test device responsiveness.
### Bugs
- We encountered a particular bug relating to iOS devices when viewing the flipcards.html page. Rather than revealing the text, the cards flip to reveal a mirror image of the image on the front of the card. Given more time, a full investigation of this issue would be undertaken but it is suspected that it is an iOS issue, where there is no support for this functionality. 

## Deployment
### GitHub Pages

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. The deployment process is as follows -
